<p><h2>Advanced Medical Technology & Care</h2>

Union Hospital is committed to bringing innovative services and treatments to the community we serve. Through medical expertise, dedication to superior patient satisfaction and cutting-edge technology, we're proud to heal our friends and neighbors close to home.

<h2>Computed Tomography Scan (CT or CAT Scan)</h2>

Computed tomography is a diagnostic imaging procedure that uses a combination of x-rays and computer technology to produce cross-sectional images (sometimes called slices) , of the body. A CT scan shows detailed images of any part of the body, including bone, tissue, organs and blood vessels. CT scan images are more detailed than standard x-rays. Read more.

davincida Vinci S. Surgical System.Union Hospital utilizes robotic surgery technology with 3D in HD (high-definition.) The da Vinci S. Surgical System integrated 3D HD laparoscopy and state-of-the-art robotic technology to virtually extend the surgeon's eyes and hands into the surgical field. The system is designed to enable new, minimally invasive options for complex surgical procedures. Read more.

<h2>Digital Mammography</h2>
Digital mammography features enhanced imaging capabilities, incredible clarity and contrast and the ability to more quickly and accurately detect cancer and other breast abnormalities. It also means shorter examination times for most patients. Similar to the technology used in digital cameras, digital mammography is a system where x-ray film is replaced by solid-state detectors that convert x-rays into electric signals. The electrical signals are used to produce images of the breast that can be seen on a computer screen. Images can be enlarged, lightened, or darkened. While digital mammography does not "see" anymore than x-ray mammography, it can be more effective for physicians diagnosing breast lumps, especially for women under age 50 who tend to have denser breast tissue.

<h2>Hospitalist Program</h2>
Union Hospital's hospitalist program is dedicated entirely to inpatient care. A hospitalist is a physician who specializes in the care of hospitalized patients and whose practice is only in the hospital, not in an office. Hospitalists are well-versed in the unique needs of hospitalized patients and work in tandem with internists, specialists and family medicine doctors to continue offering patients the very best care. If your primary physician decides to utilize hospitalist services for your inpatient admission, you can be confident that your primary physician will be informed of all the details of your stay. It is the goal of the hospitalist program to get patients healthy and back to their own doctors for follow-up care as quickly as possible.

<h2>CeilingImage-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT)</h2>

IGRT use special tools to localize the area being treated and verifies how treatment was delivered to the tumor. IGRT differs from other forms of radiation therapy in that it is especially effective in treating tumors that may move with normal breathing, such as in the chest or abdomen. According to manufacturer Varian Medical Systems, IGRT compares images taken just prior to a patient's daily therapy with treatment plans designed by their radiation oncologists. The difference between images is calculated so that the patient is accurately positioned for the most precise dosage and the area being treated.

<h2>Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)screen</h2>

In IMRT planning, the physician tells the computer the dose prescribed to the tumor and the limits that can be given to surrounding tissue. The computer then tries thousands of possibilities to come up with the ideal method to deliver the treatment. Multiple, highly collimated fixed beams, sliding windows or tissue compensators will be used to deliver the intensity modulated treatment. IMRT with compensators is considered by many to be the most precise method and certainly the most verifiable method of delivering intensity modulated treatment.

<h2>Open Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</h2>

The Panorama 1.0T High Field Open MRI is the most advanced open MRI system available and allows for improved image quality and faster exam times while the patient can enjoy the comfort of an open system. Read more.

<h2>Telecardiology</h2>

The telecardiology program provides advanced, timely cardiology consultations through telecommunications for patients seeking care and treatment for chest pain at remote locations. Via a live video conference, a cardiologist evaluated the patient's history, listens to his/her heart tones an breath sounds and provides recommendations for treatment to our caregivers.
